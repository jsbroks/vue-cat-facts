## Summary

The Vue 3 Composition API has open new possibilities for accessing the full
power of the Vue Router. Today we will be looking at using Vue Router with the
composition API, to create a cat facts webpage with full typescript support. By
the end of this video, you will hopefully have a full understanding of how to
successfully use the newly added useRoute and useRouter composition functions.
We'll also look at some changes between Vue 2 and Vue 3 and some more advanced
features like lazyloaded routes, dynamic segments, navigation guards, and adding
a 404 error page.
